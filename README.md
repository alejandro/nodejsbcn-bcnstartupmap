Barcelona Startup Map
=====================

bcnstartupmap started as an introduction to node.js session. It demonstrated how to set up a simple Express 3 node.js app with a few libraries, GET, POST and an AJAX request. A CouchDB is required to run the demo.


Future Development
------------------
Please feel free to fork and contribute to this project so we can generate a full map of startups in Barcelona on a  production-ready node.js service.


Services
--------
The demo uses a CouchDB provided by [iriscouch](http://iriscouch.com/) and [MapBox](http://mapbox.com) for map services.
